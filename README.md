reminders
=========

A Sailfish Silica app for Jolla phones. It allows the user to schedule daily reminders for recurring tasks. Its main feature compared to calendar or to-do applications is that it can reschedule the reminder X days after the last time the task was done, rather than X days after the last time the task was scheduled. This makes it well suited for scheduling cleaning and maintenance tasks, especially housework.
